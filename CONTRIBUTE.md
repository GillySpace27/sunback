# Thank you for your interest in making this package better!

This is my first package ever, so I am just learning all the ropes. 
Thank you for your contributions, 
I am glad for any support you have.

The main things that need to be done on this project are:
* Make this program work on Mac
* Make this program work on Linux
* Generally make things follow best practices
* Write tests for all of the functions, such that the code coverage can understand
* Write documentation for everything that Sphinx can understand
* Add ability for the user to specify their own parameters, at least in terms of picture display time
* Add additional channels to watch
* Make a windowed version
    * Allows for Video
* Make a version that displays multiple wavelengths at once
